public class _6_SchedulingTasks {
    /*
    Oftentimes in Java, we need to schedule a task to happen at some future
    time. We might even need to schedule the task to happen repeatedly, at
    some set interval.
    Like ExecutorService, we obtain an instance of
    ScheduledExecutorService using a factory method in the Executors
    class, as shown in the following snippet:
    ScheduledExecutorService service
    = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
    We could store an instance of ScheduledExecutorService in an
    ExecutorService variable, although doing so would mean we'd have to
    cast the object to call any scheduled methods.
