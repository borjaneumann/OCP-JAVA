    Intro
    =====
    Besides managing threads, the Concurrency API includes interfaces and
    classes that help you coordinate access to collections shared by multiple
    tasks. By collections, we are of course referring to the Java Collections
    Framework that we introduced in Chapter 14, “Generics and Collections.”
    In this section, we will demonstrate many of the concurrent classes
    available to you when using the Concurrency API.
