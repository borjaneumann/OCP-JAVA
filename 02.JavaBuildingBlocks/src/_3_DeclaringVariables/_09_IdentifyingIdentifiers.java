    An identifier is the name of a variable, method, class, interface, or package.

    There are only four rules to remember for legal identifiers:

    1) Identifiers must begin with a letter, a $ symbol, or a _ symbol.
    2) Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them.
    3) Since Java 9, a single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier.
    4) You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word.
