    /*
    An identifier is the name of a variable, method, class, interface, or package.

    There are only four rules to remember for legal identifiers:

    1) Identifiers must begin with a letter, a $ symbol, or a _ symbol.
    2) Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them.
    3) Since Java 9, a single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier.
    4) You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word.

    * The reserved words const and goto aren’t actually used in Java. They are reserved so that people
    coming from other programming languages don’t use them by accident—and in theory, in case Java
    wants to use them one day.
    ** true/false/null are not actually reserved words, but literal values. Since they cannot be used as
    identifier names, we include them in this table.
