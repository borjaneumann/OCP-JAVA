    DECLARING A VARIABLE
    --------------------
    A variable is a name for a piece of memory that stores data. When you declare
    a variable, you need to state the variable type along with giving it a name.

    String zooName;
    int numberAnimals;

    INITIALIZING A VARIABLE
    -----------------------
    Now that weâ€™ve declared a variable, we can give it a value. This is called
    initializing a variable. To initialize a variable, you just type the variable
    name followed by an equal sign, followed by the desired value:

    zooName = "The Best Zoo";
    numberAnimals = 100;


    Since you often want to initialize a variable right away, you can do so in
    the same statement as the declaration. For example, here we merge the
    previous declarations and initializations into more concise code:

    String zooName = "The Best Zoo";
    int numberAnimals = 100;
