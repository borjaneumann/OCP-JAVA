    /*
    You can also declare and initialize multiple variables in the same
    statement. Each snippet separated by a comma is a little declaration of its own.

    void sandFence() {
        String s1, s2; //legal
        String s3 = "yes", s4 = "no";//legal
    }
    void paintFence() {
        int i1, i2, i3 = 0;//legal
    }

    int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE

    Tip: the exam really does cram multiple statements onto
    the same lineâ€”partly to try to trick you and partly to fit more code on the
    screen. In the real world, please limit yourself to one declaration per
    statement and line.
