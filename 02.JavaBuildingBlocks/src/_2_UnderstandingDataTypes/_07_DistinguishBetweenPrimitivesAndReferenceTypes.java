    /*
    1) Reference types can be assigned null, which means
    they do not currently refer to an object. But what if you donâ€™t know
    the value of an int and want to assign it to null? In that case, you
    should use a numeric wrapper class, such as Integer, instead of int.

    2) Reference types can be used to call methods, assuming the reference
    is not null. Primitives do not have methods declared on them.

    3) All the primitive types have lowercase type names. All classes that
    come with Java begin with uppercase.
