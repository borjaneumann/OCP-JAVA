    Java has eight built-in data types, referred to as the Java primitive types.
    These eight data types represent the building blocks for Java objects,
    because all Java objects are just a complex collection of these primitive
    data types. That said, a primitive is not an object in Java nor does it
    represent an object. A primitive is just a single value in memory, such as a
    number or character.

    short           16-bit integral value       123
    int             32-bit integral value       123
    long            64-bit integral             value 123L
