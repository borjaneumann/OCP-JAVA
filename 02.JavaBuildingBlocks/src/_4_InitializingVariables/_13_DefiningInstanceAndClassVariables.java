    Variables that are not local variables are defined either as instance
    variables or as class variables.

    Instance Variable
    -----------------
    An instance variable, often called a field, is a value defined within a
    specific instance of an object.
    Two instances could have the same value for name, but changing the value
    for one does not modify the other.

    Class Variable
    --------------
    A class variable is one that is defined on the class level
    and shared among all instances of the class.
    It can even be publicly accessible to classes outside
    the class without requiring an instance to use.
    You can tell a variable is a class variable because it has the keyword static before it.
