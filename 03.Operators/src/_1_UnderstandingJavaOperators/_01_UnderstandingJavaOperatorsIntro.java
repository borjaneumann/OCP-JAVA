    /*
    A Java operator is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables,
    values, or literals—referred to as operands—and that returns a result.

    The term operand, which we’ll use throughout this chapter, refers to the value
    or variable the operator is being applied to.

    The output of the operation is simply referred to as the result.

    c (result) = a (operand)  + (operator) b (operand)
