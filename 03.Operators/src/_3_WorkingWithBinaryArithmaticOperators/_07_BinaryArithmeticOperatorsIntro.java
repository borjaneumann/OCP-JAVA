    Binary operators take two arguments.

    Binary operators are often combined in complex expressions
    with other binary operators; therefore, operator precedence is very
    important in evaluating expressions containing binary operators.

    +                           Adds two numeric values
    -                           Subtracts two numeric values
    *                           Multiplies two numeric values
    /                           Divides one numeric value by another
    %                           Modulus operator returns the remainder after division of one
                                numeric value by another
