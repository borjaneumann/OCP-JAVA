public class _13_AssigmentOperatorsReturnValue {
    /*
    The result of an assignment is an expression in and of itself,
    equal to the value of the assignment.

    long wolf = 5;
    long coyote = (wolf=3);
    System.out.println(wolf); // 3
    System.out.println(coyote); // 3

    The key here is that (wolf=3) does two things. First, it sets the value of
    the variable wolf to be 3. Second, it returns a value of the assignment,
    which is also 3.

    KEEP IN MIND!!
    boolean healthy = false;
    if(healthy = true)
    System.out.print("Good!");
    While this may look like a test if healthy is true, itâ€™s actually assigning
    healthy a value of true. The result of the assignment is the value of the
    assignment, which is true, resulting in this snippet printing Good!
