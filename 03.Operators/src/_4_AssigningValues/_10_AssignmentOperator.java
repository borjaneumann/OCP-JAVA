    An assignment operator is a binary operator that modifies, or assigns, the
    variable on the left side of the operator, with the result of the value on the
    right side of the equation. The simplest assignment operator is the =
    assignment.

    Java will throw a compiler exception if it detects that you are trying to convert from larger
    to smaller data types without casting.
