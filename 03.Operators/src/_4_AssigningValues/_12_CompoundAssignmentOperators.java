    Compound assignment operators

    +=                  Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns
                        the sum to the variable
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -=                  Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and
                        assigns the difference to the variable
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *=                  Multiplies the value on the right with the variable on the left and
                        assigns the product to the variable
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /=                  Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and
                        assigns the quotient to the variable
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    int camel = 2, giraffe = 3;
    camel = camel * giraffe; // Simple assignment operator
    camel *= giraffe; // Compound assignment operator

    The left side of the compound operator can be applied only to a variable
    that is already defined and cannot be used to declare a new variable. In
    this example, if camel were not already defined, then the expression camel
    *= giraffe would not compile.

    Compound operators are useful for more than just shorthandâ€”they can
    also save us from having to explicitly cast a value.
