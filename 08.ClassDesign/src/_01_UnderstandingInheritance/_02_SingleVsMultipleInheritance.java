    Java supports single inheritance, by which a class may inherit from only
    one direct parent class. Java also supports multiple levels of inheritance,
    by which one class may extend another class, which in turn extends
    another class. You can have any number of levels of inheritance, allowing
    each descendant to gain access to its ancestorâ€™s members.
    Each child has exactly one parent.

    Preventing inheritance
    ----------------------
    It is possible in Java to prevent a class from being extended by marking
    the class with the final modifier. If you try to define a class that inherits
    from a final class, then the class will fail to compile.
