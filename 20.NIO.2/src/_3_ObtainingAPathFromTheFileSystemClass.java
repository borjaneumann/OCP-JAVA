    /*
    CONNECTING TO REMOTE FILE SYSTEMS
    While most of the time we want access to a Path object that is
    within the local file system, the FileSystems class does give us the
    freedom to connect to a remote file system, as follows:

    // FileSystems factory method
    public static FileSystem getFileSystem(URI uri)

    The following shows how such a method can be used:

    FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.getFileSystem(
    new URI("http://www.selikoff.net"));
    Path path = fileSystem.getPath("duck.txt");

    This code is useful when we need to construct Path objects
    frequently for a remote file system. NIO.2 gives us the power to
    connect to both local and remote file systems, which is a major
    improvement over the legacy java.io.File class.
