public class _2_AbsoluteVSRelativePaths {

    /*
    Determining whether a path is relative or absolute is actually file‚Äê
    system dependent. To match the exam, we adopt the following
    conventions:

    If a path starts with a forward slash ( /), it is absolute, with / as the
    root directory. Examples: /bird/parrot.png and /bird/../data/./info

    If a path starts with a drive letter ( c:), it is absolute, with the drive
    letter as the root directory. Examples: c:/bird/parrot.png and d:/bird/../data/./info

    Otherwise, it is a relative path. Examples: bird/parrot.png and bird/../data/./info
