public class _1_IntroducingNIO2 {

    /*
     In this chapter, we focus on the java.nio version 2 API, or NIO.2 for short,
     to interact with files. NIO.2 is an acronym that stands for the second version
     of the Non‐blocking Input/Output API, and it is sometimes referred to as the “New I/O.
     When talking about streams we refered to functional programming.

    By legacy, we mean that the preferred approach for working with files and
    directories with newer software applications is to use NIO.2, rather than
    java.io.File.

    People sometimes refer to NIO.2 as just NIO, although for clarity
    and to distinguish it from the first version of NIO, we will refer to it
    as NIO.2 throughout the chapter.
