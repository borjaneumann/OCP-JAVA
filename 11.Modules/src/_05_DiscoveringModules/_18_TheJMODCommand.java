    /*
    The most important thing to remember is that jmod is only for working
    with the JMOD files.
    JMOD files are recommended only when you have native libraries or something
    that can’t go inside a JAR file. This is unlikely to affect you in the real world.

    Conveniently, you don’t have to memorize the syntax for jmod.
