    3) Before we can run modular code, we need to compile it. Other than the
    module-path option, this code should look familiar from Chapter 1:

    javac --module-path mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java
    feeding/module-info.java

    As a review, the -d option specifies the directory to place the class files in.
    The end of the command is a list of the .java files to compile. You can
    list the files individually or use a wildcard for all .java files in a
    subdirectory.


    When youâ€™re entering commands at the command line, they should
    be typed all on one line. We use line breaks in the book to make the
    commands easier to read and study. If you wanted to use multiple
    lines at the command prompt, the approach varies by operating
    system. Linux uses a backslash (\) as the line break.
