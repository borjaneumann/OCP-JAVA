    3) Before we can run modular code, we need to compile it. Other than the
    module-path option, this code should look familiar from Chapter 1:

    javac --module-path mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java
    feeding/module-info.java

    javac --module-path mods -d feeding feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java feeding/module-info.java

    As a review, the -d option specifies the directory to place the class files in.
    The end of the command is a list of the .java files to compile. You can
    list the files individually or use a wildcard for all .java files in a
    subdirectory.

    The new part is the module-path. This option indicates the location of any
    custom module files. In this example, module-path could have been
    omitted since there are no dependencies. You can think of module-path as
    replacing the classpath option when you are working on a modular
    program.

    When youâ€™re entering commands at the command line, they should
    be typed all on one line. We use line breaks in the book to make the
    commands easier to read and study. If you wanted to use multiple
    lines at the command prompt, the approach varies by operating
    system. Linux uses a backslash (\) as the line break.

    The syntax --module-path and -p are equivalent. That means we could have
    written many other commands in place of the previous command. The
    following four commands show the -p option:

    javac -p mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java
    feeding/*.java

    javac -p mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/*.java
    feeding/module-info.java

    javac -p mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/Task.java
    feeding/module-info.java

    javac -p mods
    -d feeding
    feeding/zoo/animal/feeding/Task.java
    feeding/*.java
