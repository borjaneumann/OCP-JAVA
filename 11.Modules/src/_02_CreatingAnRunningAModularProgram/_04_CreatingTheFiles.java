    1) Java files and module-info.java file.

    There are a few key differences between a module-info file and a regular Java class:
    1.1) The module-info file must be in the root directory of your module.
    Regular Java classes should be in packages.
    1.2) The module-info file must use the keyword module instead of class,
    interface, or enum.
    1.3) The module name follows the naming rules for package names. It often
    includes periods (.) in its name. Regular class and package names are not
    allowed to have dashes (-). Module names follow the same rule.

    The module-info.java file can be empty!

    2) The next step is to make sure the files are in the right directory structure.
    Also, note that we created a directory called mods at the same level as the
    module. We will use it for storing the module artifacts a little later in the
    chapter. This directory can be named anything, but mods is a common
    name. If you are following along with the online code example, note that
    the mods directory is not included, because it is empty.
