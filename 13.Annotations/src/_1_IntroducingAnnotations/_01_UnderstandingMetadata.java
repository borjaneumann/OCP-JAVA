    /*
    Annotations are all about metadata.
    Metadata is data that provides information about other data.

    Example:
    Imagine our zoo is having a sale on tickets.
    The attribute data includes the price, the expiration date, and the number of tickets
    purchased. In other words, the attribute data is the transactional
    information that makes up the ticket sale and its contents.

    On the other hand, the metadata includes the rules, properties, or
    relationships surrounding the ticket sales. Patrons must buy at least one
    ticket, as a sale of zero or negative tickets is silly. Maybe the zoo is having
    a problem with scalpers, so they add a rule that each person can buy a
    maximum of five tickets a day. These metadata rules describe information
    about the ticket sale but are not part of the ticket sale.

    Note:
    While annotations allow you to insert rules around data, it does not
    mean the values for these rules need to be defined in the code, aka
    “hard‐coded.” In many frameworks, you can define the rules and
    relationships in the code but read the values from elsewhere.
