    /*Up to now, we’ve been referring to the String and StringBuilder classes
    as a “sequence of characters.” This is true. They are implemented using an
    array of characters.

    An array is an area of memory on the heap with space
    for a designated number of elements.

    A String is implemented as an array with some methods that you might
    want to use when dealing with characters specifically.

    A StringBuilder is implemented as an array where the array object is
    replaced with a new bigger array object when it runs out of space to store all the characters.

    A big difference is that an array can be of any other Java type.

    An array is an ordered list. It can contain duplicates. In this
    section, we’ll look at creating an array of primitives and objects, sorting,
    searching, varargs, and multidimensional arrays.
