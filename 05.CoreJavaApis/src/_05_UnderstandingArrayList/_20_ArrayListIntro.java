    /*
    An array has one glaring shortcoming: You have to know how many
    elements will be in the array when you create it, and then you are stuck
    with that choice. Just like a StringBuilder, an ArrayList can change
    capacity at runtime as needed. Like an array, an ArrayList is an ordered
    sequence that allows duplicates.

    As when we used Arrays.sort, ArrayList requires an import. To use it,
    you must have either of the following two statements in your class:

    import java.util.*; // import whole package
    import java.util.ArrayList; // import just ArrayList

    In this section, weâ€™ll look at creating an ArrayList, common methods,
    autoboxing, conversion, and sorting.
