    Although the parameter list is required, it doesnâ€™t have to contain any
    parameters. This means you can just have an empty pair of parentheses
    after the method name, as follows:

    void nap(){}

    public void walk1(){}
    public void walk2 {} // Does not compile
    public void walk3(int a){}
    public void walk4 (int a;int b){} // Does not compile
    public void walk5 (int a, int b) {}
