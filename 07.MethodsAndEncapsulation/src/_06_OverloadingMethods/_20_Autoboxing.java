    /*
    In Chapter 5, you saw how Java will convert a primitive int to an object
    Integer to add it to an ArrayList through the wonders of autoboxing.
    This works for code you write too.

    public void fly(Integer numMiles) {}

    This means calling fly(3) will call the previous method as expected.
    However, what happens if you have both a primitive and an integer
    version?

    public void fly(int numMiles) {}
    public void fly(Integer numMiles) {}

    Java will match the int numMiles version.
    Java tries to use the most specific parameter list it can find.
    When the primitive int version isnâ€™t present, it will autobox.
    However, when the primitive int version is provided,
    there is no reason for Java to do the extra work of autoboxing.
