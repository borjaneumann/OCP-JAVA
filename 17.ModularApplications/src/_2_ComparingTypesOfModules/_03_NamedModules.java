    /*
    A named module is one containing a module窶進nfo file. To review, this file
    appears in the root of the JAR alongside one or more packages. Unless
    otherwise specified, a module is a named module. Named modules appear
    on the module path rather than the classpath. You'll learn what happens if
    a JAR containing a module窶進nfo file is on the classpath. For now, just
    know it is not considered a named module because it is not on the module
    path.

    As a way of remembering this, a named module has the name inside the
    module窶進nfo file and is on the module path. Figure 17.1 shows the
    contents of a JAR file for a named module. It contains two packages in
    addition to the module窶進nfo.class.
