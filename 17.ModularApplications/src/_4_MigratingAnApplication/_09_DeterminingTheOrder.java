    Before we can migrate our application to use modules, we need to know
    how the packages and libraries in the existing application are structured.
    Suppose we have a simple application with three JAR files, as shown in
    Figure 17.4.

    The dependencies between projects form a graph. Both of the
    representations in Figure 17.4 are equivalent. The arrows show the
    dependencies by pointing from the project that will require the
    dependency to the one that makes it available. In the language of modules,
    the arrow will go from requires to the exports.
    The order is not always unique.
