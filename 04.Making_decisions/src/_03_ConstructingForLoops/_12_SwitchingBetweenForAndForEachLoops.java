        COMPARING FOR AND FOR-EACH LOOPS

        Since for and for-each both use the same keyword, you might be
        wondering how they are related. While this discussion is out of
        scope for the exam, letâ€™s take a moment to explore how for-each
        loops are converted to for loops by the compiler.
        When for-each was introduced in Java 5, it was added as a compile-time enhancement.
        This means that Java actually converts the for-each loop into a standard for loop during compilation. For example,
        assuming names is an array of String as we saw in the first example,
        the following two loops are equivalent:

        for(String name : names) {
        System.out.print(name + ", ");
        }
        for(int i=0; i < names.length; i++) {
        String name = names[i];
        System.out.print(name + ", ");
        }

        For objects that inherit Iterable, there is a different, but similar,
        conversion. For example, assuming values is an instance of
        List<Integer>, the following two loops are equivalent:

        for(int value : values) {
        System.out.print(value + ", ");
        }
        for(Iterator<Integer> i = values.iterator(); i.hasNext();
        ) {
        int value = i.next();
        System.out.print(value + ", ");
        }
        Notice that in the second version, there is no update statement in the
        for loop as next() both retrieves the next available value and
        moves the iterator forward.
