    In fact, the only reason we even need a class structure to start a Java
    program is because the language requires it. To compile and execute this
    code, type it into a file called Zoo.java and execute the following:

    javac Zoo.java
    java Zoo

//    public static void main(String args []) {
//    }
//    public static void main(String... args) {
//    }

}
