    Every six months, the version number of Java gets incremented. Java 11
    came out in September 2018. This means that Java 11 will not be the latest
    version when you download the JDK to study for the exam. However, you
    should still use Java 11 to study with since this is a Java 11 exam. The
    rules and behavior can change with later versions of Java. You wouldnâ€™t
    want to get a question wrong because you studied with a different version
    of Java!

    Every three years, Oracle has a long-term support (LTS) release. Unlike
    non-LTS versions that are supported for only six months, LTS releases
    have patches and upgrades available for at least three years. Even after the
    next LTS, Java 17, comes out, be sure to use Java 11 to study for the Java
    11 certification exam.
