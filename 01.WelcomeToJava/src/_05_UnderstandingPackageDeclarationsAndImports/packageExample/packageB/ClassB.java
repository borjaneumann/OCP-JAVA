Very important:
1) When compiling you need to be in the path above the packages are.
2) javac 05_UnderstandingPackageDeclarationsAndImports.packageExample.packageB\ClassB.java
I'm guessing that when entering the above command the path starts from C:\ to the package directory.
3)java 05_UnderstandingPackageDeclarationsAndImports.packageExample.packageB.ClassB
(Keep an eye on the dot between packageB and ClassB!!)

/*
Compiling and Running Code with packages
========================================
We could have also complied tha classes one by one separated by a space, though when Java main is compiled,
it will also compiled the needed classes.

javac 05_UnderstandingPackageDeclarationsAndImports.packageExample.packageB\ClassB.java
05_UnderstandingPackageDeclarationsAndImports.packageExample.packageA\ClassA.java
 */
/*
Compiling With WildCards
=========================
You can use an asterisk to specify that youâ€™d like to include all Java
files in a directory. This is convenient when you have a lot of files in
a package. We can rewrite the previous javac command like this:

packagea = 05_UnderstandingPackageDeclarationsAndImports.packageExample.packageA
packageb = 05_UnderstandingPackageDeclarationsAndImports.packageExample.packageB

javac packagea/*.java packageb/*.java

However, you cannot use a wildcard to include subdirectories. If you
were to write javac *.java, the code in the packages would not be
picked up.
