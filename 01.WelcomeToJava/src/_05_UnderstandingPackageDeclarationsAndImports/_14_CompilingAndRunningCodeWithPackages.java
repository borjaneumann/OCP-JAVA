    1. Create first class.  C:\temp\packagea\ClassA.java    /tmp/packagea/ClassA.java
    2. Create second class. C:\temp\packageb\ClassB.java    /tmp/packageb/ClassB.java
    3. Go to directory.     cd C:\temp                      cd /tmp

    We will follow the classes from creatingANewPackage

    javac packagea/ClassA.java packageb/ClassB.java -> all existing classes get compiled. The new class files
    will be saved in the directories where the java files are.
    java packageb.ClassB -> Only the class with the main. We use a dot instead of the bar

    COMPILING WITH WILDCARDS
    You can use an asterisk to specify that youâ€™d like to include all Java
    files in a directory. This is convenient when you have a lot of files in
    a package. We can rewrite the previous javac command like this:

    javac packagea/*.java packageb/*.java


    However, you cannot use a wildcard to include subdirectories. If you
    were to write javac *.java, the code in the packages would not be
    picked up.
