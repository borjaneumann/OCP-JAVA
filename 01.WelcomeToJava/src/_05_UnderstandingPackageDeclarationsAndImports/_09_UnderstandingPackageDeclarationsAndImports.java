    Java comes with thousands of built-in classes, and there are countless
    more from developers like you. With all those classes, Java needs a way to
    organize them. It handles this in a way similar to a file cabinet. You put all
    your pieces of paper in folders. Java puts classes in packages. These are
    logical groupings for classes.

    Java classes are grouped into packages.
    Package names are hierarchical. If it begins with java or javax, this
    means it came with the JDK. If it starts with something else, it likely
    shows where it came from using the website name in reverse. For
    example, com.amazon.javabook tells us the code came from
    Amazon.com.
