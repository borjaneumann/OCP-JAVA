    /*8 Benefist Of Java
    1) OBJECT ORIENTED. Java is an object-oriented language, which means all
    code is defined in classes, and most of those classes can be instantiated
    into objects.

    2) ENCAPSULATION. Java supports access modifiers to protect data from
    unintended access and modification. Most people consider encapsulation
    to be an aspect of object-oriented languages

    3) PLATFORM INDEPENDENT. Java is an interpreted language that gets compiled
    to bytecode. A key benefit is that Java code gets compiled once rather than
    needing to be recompiled for different operating systems. This is known as
    “write once, run everywhere.”

    4) ROBUST. One of the major advantages of Java over C++ is that it prevents
    memory leaks. Java manages memory on its own and does garbage
    collection automatically.

    5) SIMPLE. Simpler than C++

    6) SECURE. Java code runs inside the JVM. This creates a sandbox that makes
    it hard for Java code to do evil things to the computer it is running on.

    7) MULTITHREADED. allow multiple pieces of code to run at
    the same time.

    8) BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY. Deprecation is a technique to
    accomplish this where code is flagged to indicate it shouldn’t be used.
    This lets developers know a different approach is preferred so they can
    start changing the code.
