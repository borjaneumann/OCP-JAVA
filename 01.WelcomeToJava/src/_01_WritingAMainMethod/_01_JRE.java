    WHERE DID THE JRE GO?
    =====================
    In previous versions of Java, you could download a Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE) instead of the full JDK. The JRE was a subset of
    the JDK that was used for running a program but could not compile
    one. It was literally a subset. In fact, if you looked inside the
    directory structure of a JDK in older versions of Java, you would see
    a folder named jre.
    In Java 11, the JRE is no longer available as a stand-alone download
    or a subdirectory of the JDK. People can use the full JDK when
    running a Java program. Alternatively, developers can supply an
    executable that contains the required pieces that would have been in
    the JRE. The jlink command creates this executable.
    While the JRE is not in scope for the exam, knowing what changed
    may help you eliminate wrong answers.
