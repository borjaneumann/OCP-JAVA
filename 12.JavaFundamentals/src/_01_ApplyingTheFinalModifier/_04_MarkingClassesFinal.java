    /*
    Lastly, the final modifier can be applied to class declarations as well.
    A final class is one that cannot be extended.
    For example, the following does not compile:

    public final class Reptile {}

    public class Snake extends Reptile {} //It will not compile...

    Like we saw with final methods, classes cannot be marked both
    abstract and final. For example, the following two declarations do not
    compile:

    public abstract final class Eagle {} //Does not compile

    public final interface Hawk {} // Does not compile.

    The compiler automatically applies the implicit abstract modifier to each
    interface declaration. Just like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be marked final.
