    <T> allows the interface to take an object of a specified type.
    Now that we have a functional interface, we'll show
    you how to implement it using a lambda expression.

    The relationship between functional interfaces and lambda expressions
    is as follows: any functional interface can be implemented as a lambda expression.

    Lambda expressions rely on the notion of deferred execution.
    Deferred execution means that code is specified now but runs later.
