    The System.in returns an InputStream and is used to retrieve text input
    from the user. It is commonly wrapped with a BufferedReader via an
    InputStreamReader to use the readLine() method.

    var reader = new BufferedReader(new
    InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String userInput = reader.readLine();
    System.out.println("You entered: " + userInput);

    When executed, this application first fetches text from the user until the
    user presses the Enter key. It then outputs the text the user entered to the
    screen.
