    /*
    Data is stored in a file system (and memory) as a 0 or 1, called a bit. Since
    it's really hard for humans to read/write data that is just 0s and 1s, they are
    grouped into a set of 8 bits, called a byte.
    What about the Java byte primitive type? As you'll see later when we get
    to I/O streams, values are often read or written streams using byte values
    and arrays.

    THE ASCII CHARACTERS
    ====================
    Using a little arithmetic (2 ), we see a byte can be set in one of 256
    possible permutations. These 256 values form the alphabet for our
    computer system to be able to type characters like a, #, and 7.
    Historically, the 256 characters are referred to as ASCII characters,
    based on the encoding standard that defined them. Given all of the
    languages and emojis available today, 256 characters is actually
    pretty limiting. Many newer standards have been developed that rely
    on additional bytes to display characters.
