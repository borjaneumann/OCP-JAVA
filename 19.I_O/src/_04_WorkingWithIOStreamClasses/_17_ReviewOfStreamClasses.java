    /*
    The InputStreamReader class wraps an InputStream with a Reader,
    while the OutputStreamWriter class wraps an OutputStream with a Writer.

    try (Reader r = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
    Writer w = new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)) {
    }

    These classes are incredibly convenient and are also unique in that
    they are the only I/O stream classes to have both InputStream/
    OutputStream and Reader/ Writer in their name.
