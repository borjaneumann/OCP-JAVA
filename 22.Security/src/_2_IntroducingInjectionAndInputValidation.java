    Concepts:
    ========
    1. Injection is an attack where dangerous input runs in a program as part of a
    command. For example, user input is often used in database queries or
    I/O. In this section, we will look at how to protect your code against
    injection using a PreparedStatement and input validation.

    2. An exploit is an attack that takes advantage of weak security.

    3. There are many sources of untrusted data. For the exam, you need to be
    aware of user input, reading from files, and retrieving data from a
    database. In the real world, any data that did not originate from your
    program should be considered suspect.
