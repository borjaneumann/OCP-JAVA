    Intro
    =====
    (DoS) - A denial of service (DoS) attack is when a hacker makes one or more
    requests with the intent of disrupting legitimate requests. Most denial of
    service attacks require multiple requests to bring down their targets.
    Some attacks send a very large request that can even bring down the application
    in one shot. In this book, we will focus on denial of service attacks.
    Unless otherwise specified, a denial of service attack comes from one
    machine. It may make many requests, but they have the same origin.

    (DDoS) - By contrast, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a denial of
    service attack that comes from many sources at once. For example, many
    machines may attack the target. In this section, we will look at some
    common sources of denial of service issues.
