    //List: A list is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate entries. Elements in a list can be accessed by an int index.

    //Set: A set is a collection that does not allow duplicate entries.

    //Queue: A queue is a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing. A typical queue processes its elements in a first‐in, first‐
    //out order, but other orderings are possible.

    //Map: A map is a collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed. The elements in a map are key/value pairs.


    //Some examples below
    Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    Collection<String> set = new HashSet<>();
    Collection<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
