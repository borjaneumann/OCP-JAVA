    An abstract class may include nonabstract methods and constructors.
    One of the most important features of an abstract class is that it is not
    actually required to include any abstract methods.

    Although an abstract class doesnâ€™t have to declare any abstract methods,
    an abstract method can only be defined in an abstract class or an
    interface.
    Like the final modifier, the abstract modifier can be placed before or
    after the access modifier in class and method declarations
    There are some restrictions on the placement of the abstract modifier.
    The abstract modifier cannot be placed after the class keyword in a
    class declaration, nor after the return type in a method declaration.
