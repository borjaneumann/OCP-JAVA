    Abstract Reference Types
    ========================
    When working with abstract types, you may prefer to work with the
    abstract reference types, rather than the concrete class. This is especially
    common when defining method parameters.
    public class Zoo {
        public void sortAndPrintZooAnimals(List<String> animals) {
        Collections.sort(animals);
        for(String a : animals) {
            System.out.println(a);
    }}}
