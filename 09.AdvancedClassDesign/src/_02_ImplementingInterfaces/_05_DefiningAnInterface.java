    Intro and Definition
    =======================
    Although Java doesnâ€™t allow multiple inheritance of state, it does allow a
    class to implement any number of interfaces. An interface is an abstract
    data type are that declares a list of abstract methods that any class
    implementing the interface must provide. An interface can also include
    constant variables. Both abstract methods and constant variables included
    with an interface are implicitly assumed to be public.

    With Java 8, interfaces were updated to include static and default methods.
    A default method is one in which the interface method has a body
    and is not marked abstract. It was added for backward
    compatibility, allowing an older class to use a new version of an
    interface that contains a new method, without having to modify the
    existing class.
    In Java 9, interfaces were updated to support private and private
    static methods. Both of these types were added for code reusability
    within an interface declaration and cannot be called outside the
    interface definition.
