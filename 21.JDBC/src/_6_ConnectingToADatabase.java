    /*
    The first step in doing anything with a database is connecting to it. First,
    we will show you how to build the JDBC URL. Then, we will show you
    how to use it to get a Connection to the database.

    BUILDING A JDBC URL
    ===================
    To access a website, you need to know the URL of the website. To access
    your email, you need to know your username and password. JDBC is no
    different. To access a database, you need to know this information about
    it.

    A JDBC URL has a variety of formats. They have three
    parts in common.
    The first piece is always the same. It is the protocol jdbc.
    The second part is the subprotocol, which is the name of the database such as derby, mysql, or postgres.
    The third part is the subname, which is a database‚Äêspecific format.

    Colons ( :) separate the three parts.

    jdbc:postgres://localhost:5432/zoo
