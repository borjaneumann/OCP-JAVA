    /*
    Our sample database has two tables. One has a row for each species that is
    in our zoo. The other has a row for each animal. These two relate to each
    other because an animal belongs to a species. These relationships are why
    this type of database is called a relational database.

    Each table has a primary key, which gives us a unique way to reference each row.
    After all, two animals might have the same name, but they can't have the same ID.

    In some situations, it is a combination of columns called a
    compound key. For example, a student identifier and year might be a
    compound key.
    There are two rows and three columns in the exhibits table and five rows
    and three columns in the names table. You do need to know about rows
    and columns for the exam.

    We provide a program to download, install, and set up Derby to run
    the examples in this chapter. You don't have to understand it for the
    exam.
    Parts of SQL called database definition language (DDL) and
    database manipulation language (DML) are used to do so.
