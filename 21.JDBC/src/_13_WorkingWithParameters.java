    However, everything is hard‚Äêcoded. We want to be able to pass in the
    values as parameters. However, we don't want the caller of this method to
    need to write SQL or know the exact details of our database.

    Instead of specifying the three values in the SQL, we can use a question mark ( ?) instead.
    A bind variable is a placeholder that lets you specify the actual values at runtime.
    A bind variable is like a parameter, and you will see bind variables referenced as both variables and parameters.
    We can rewrite our SQL statement using bind variables.

    You can think of the bind variables as a list of parameters where each one gets set in turn.
    Notice how the bind variables can be set in any order.

    Remember that JDBC starts counting columns with 1 rather than 0.
    A common exam (and interview) question tests that you know this!

    The rule is only that they are each set before the query is
    executed. Let's see what happens if you don't set all the bind variables.
