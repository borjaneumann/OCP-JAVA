    BATCHING STATEMENTS
    ===================
    JDBC supports batching so you can run multiple statements in fewer
    trips to the database.
    For example, if you need to insert 1,000 records into the database, then inserting
    them as a single network call (as opposed to 1,000 network calls) is
    usually a lot faster.

    You don't need to know the addBatch() and executeBatch()
    methods for the exam, but they are useful in practice.

    /*
    Now we call this method with two names:
    register(conn, 100, 1, "Elias", "Ester");

    The output shows the array has two elements since there are two
    different items in the batch. Each one added one row in the database.
    [1, 1]

    When using batching, you should call executeBatch() at a set
    interval, such as every 10,000 records (rather than after ten million).
    Waiting too long to send the batch to the database could produce
    operations that are so large that they freeze the client (or even worse
    the database!).
