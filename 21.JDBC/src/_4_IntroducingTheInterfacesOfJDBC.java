    For the exam you need to know five key interfaces of JDBC.
    With JDBC, the concrete classes come from the JDBC driver. Each
    database has a different JAR file with these classes.

    This driver JAR contains an implementation of these key interfaces along
    with a number of other interfaces. The key is that the provided
    implementations know how to communicate with a database.
