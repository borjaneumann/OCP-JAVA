        //The count() method determines the number of elements in a finite stream.
        //. The count() method is a reduction because it looks at each
        //element in the stream and returns a single value.

        //min() and max()
        //The min() and max() methods allow you to pass a custom comparator and
        //find the smallest or largest value in a finite stream according to that sort
        //order. Like the count() method, min() and max() hang on an infinite
        //stream because they cannot be sure that a smaller or larger value isn't
        //coming later in the stream. Both methods are reductions because they
        //return a single value after looking at the entire stream.
        //Optional<T> min(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
        //Optional<T> max(Comparator<? super T> comparator)
        Stream<String> t = Stream.of("monkey", "ape", "bonobo");
        Optional<String> min = t.min((s1, s2) -> s1.length()- s2.length());
        min.ifPresent(System.out::println); // ape

        Optional<?> minEmpty = Stream.empty().min((s1, s2) -> 0);
        System.out.println(minEmpty.isPresent()); // false
        //Since the stream is empty, the comparator is never called, and no value is
        //present in the Optional.
        /*What if you need both the min() and max() values of the same
        stream? For now, you can't have both, at least not using these
        methods. Remember, a stream can have only one terminal operation.
        Once a terminal operation has been run, the stream cannot be used again.*/

        //findAny() and findFirst()
        //The findAny() and findFirst() methods return an element of the stream
        //unless the stream is empty. If the stream is empty, they return an empty
        //Optional. This is the first method you've seen that can terminate with an
        //infinite stream.
        /*These methods are terminal operations but not reductions. The reason is
        that they sometimes return without processing all of the elements. This
        means that they return a value based on the stream but do not reduce the
        entire stream into one value.*/

        /*The allMatch(), anyMatch(), and noneMatch() methods search a stream
        and return information about how the stream pertains to the predicate.
        These may or may not terminate for infinite streams. It depends on the
        data. Like the find methods, they are not reductions because they do not
        necessarily look at all of the elements.*/

        //Remember that allMatch(), anyMatch(), and noneMatch() return a
        //boolean. By contrast, the find methods return an Optional because
        //they return an element of the stream.

        //forEach()
        //Like in the Java Collections Framework, it is common to iterate over the
        //elements of a stream. As expected, calling forEach() on an infinite stream
        //does not terminate. Since there is no return value, it is not a reduction.

        Stream<Integer> loop = Stream.of(1);
        //for (Integer i : loop) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
        //While forEach() sounds like a loop, it is really a terminal operator for
        //streams. Streams cannot be used as the source in a for‚Äêeach loop to run
        //because they don't implement the Iterable interface.
