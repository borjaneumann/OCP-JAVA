    A program can fail for just about any reason. Here are just a few
    possibilities:
    - The code tries to connect to a website, but the Internet connection is down.
    - You made a coding mistake and tried to access an invalid index in an array.
    - One method calls another with a value that the method doesn’t support.

    Some of these are coding mistakes. Others are completely
    beyond your control. Your program can’t help it if the Internet connection
    goes down. What it can do is deal with the situation.
